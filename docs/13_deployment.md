# Deployment

## Why Separate the UI and API?

1. Simple, low-risk, UI only deploys
1. Separates concerns
    * Separate teams
    * Less to understand
    * Scale back-end separately
1. Cheap UI hosting (hosting only static files)
1. Serve UI via a content delivery network
1. Use the API tech you like

## Cloud hosting
